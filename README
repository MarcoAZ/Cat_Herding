I made this game following this tutorial: http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/
I've made some tweaks and plan to use this game to learn to code new features.
*************
10/30/2013
+added my first sprite for a player
+added game over pop up (looks plain for now)

still looking to add:
-sprites for cats!
-better cat AI. Less pong animation, more wandering.


*************
10/29/2013
+made player twice as big
+moved timer and counter off canvas

still to add:
-pop up when time runs out
-animations when moving
-cats wander instead of bouncing off walls

*************

+added a timer :) took a while to figure out to be honest. Any advice to tidy it up would be appreciated.

Still want to add:
-pop that displays you score after time runs out. 
-bigger player sprite
-cats actively avoid player
-running animations
