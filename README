I made this game following this tutorial: http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/
I've made some tweaks and plan to use this game to learn to code new features.

+added a timer :) took a while to figure out to be honest. Any advice to tidy it up would be appreciated.

Still want to add:
-pop that displays you score after time runs out. 
-bigger player sprite
-cats actively avoid player
-running animations
